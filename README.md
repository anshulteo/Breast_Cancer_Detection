Breast Cancer Classification System
A deep learning–based web application that classifies breast ultrasound images into Benign, Malignant, and Normal categories.
The project uses TensorFlow/Keras for model training and Streamlit for an interactive UI.

Features
CNN-based classifier using transfer learning (e.g., MobileNetV2/ResNet-style backbone)

Three classes: Benign, Malignant, Normal

Image preprocessing: resizing, RGB conversion, normalization

Data augmentation to improve generalization

Class weighting to handle imbalanced data

Early stopping & learning rate scheduling during training

Streamlit web app for real-time image upload and prediction

Displays:

Predicted class

Confidence score

Per-class probability distribution
